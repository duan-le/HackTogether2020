##  Inspiration

* It was hard to find information about COVID cases in universities. We wanted to have a place where all of that information could be aggregated.

## What it does

* It shows recent COVID cases throughout universities
* It shows recent COVID cases generally throughout specific provinces
* It has links to mental health institutions near each university

## How we built it

* Front-end was developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap
* Backend was developed using PHP, MySQL, and Python
* Hosted on Heroku

## Challenges we ran into

* It was a challenge to unify the data as it was different for each university

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

* We are proud to have fully completed the project in the specified amount of time
* We implemented a graphic to supplement the data provided by the tables

## What we learned

* We learned a lot about development in general
* We stepped out of our comfort zone in order to try new languages or development methods

## What's next for COVID Overflow

* Next we want to add more universities to our dashboard
* We want to be able to compare data between universities
